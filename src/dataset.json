I told her I understood but now she’s complaining that I’ve rejected the offer, even though she’ll pay me “more than I’ll ever deserve.”<br/><br/>I’m torn on this, my mum completely understands with my pov but my dad says it wouldn’t hurt to help out from time to time. reddit, AITA?","verdict":"NTA"},{"id":"pes002","title":"AITA for bringing home condoms even though I don't plan on using em myself?","text":"I, 21, f attended my college's health fair with a friend and was given a bag of condoms. since my friend didn't need hers, she gave hers to me.<br/><br/>I brought them home and forgot the bag was on my hand. when my parents confronted meant it, I told them they were condoms. they were livid as hell...as \"progressive\" as they are, they shamed me about this and wanted me to reflect on the kind of character I am to bring home free condoms. currently crying in my room about this<br/><br/>(my reason for bringing em home was bc I thought of condoms kinda like feminine products, and I'll make sure to put some it in my feminine care bag) also note: my mom compared me \"bringing home the condoms\" to \"bringing home coke\" or other types of substances like wtf 😳<br/><br/>edit pt 2: still haven't spoken to my parents in like an hour. still not gonna back down","verdict":"NTA"},{"id":"mxi2tk","title":"AITA for not giving my ipad to my 5year old twin nieces.","text":"my parents rarely buy me anything and after a lot of bargaining I convinced them to buy me an ipad, and now that my brother asks me for the ipad for their kids to play, I don't want to give it to them.

I've been cooking at home almost every meal for the last month. cooking makes a lot of dishes. I have told my boyfriend several times that he needs to do the dishes since I'm coming the food. ordering out isn't an option and we need to eat so he needs to share the burden even though he can't cook.<br/><br/>well earlier today I actually saw my boyfriend doing the dishes after I made lunch. instinctively I thanked him for doing the dishes but then I remembered that is his responsibility and reminded him of how unfair it was to me for him not to do the dishes every day. I told him I take back my thanks and he should be doing more without me asking.<br/><br/>my boyfriend is now very upset at me and insists that I need to stop \"nagging\" (typical...) him while he's doing housework but if he was doing it regularly from the start I wouldn't have had to say anything. am I the asshole?","verdict":"YTA"},{"id":"cjs6wi","title":"AITA for not letting receipt checkers search my bag?","text":"I was shopping at a large chain grocery store and as I walked out the door I was asked to look at my receipt.

I feel like I was right because I showed them my receipt and that should be it but my mother feels like I created unnecessary drama when I could’ve just shown what was in my bag because I didn’t steal.

I explained to her that gambling is wrong. it's a good way to lose your money and can cause you to get into fights. I told her it was a very stupid thing to do, and I hoped she learned her lesson. anyway, when we got home I explained to my wife what happened, and she reprimanded me for not buying the candy for her or giving her an extra $5 to replace her allowance. I told her if I'd done that, she wouldn't have learned anything. she wasn't hearing it though.","verdict":"NTA"},{"id":"tdo4ap","title":"AITA for telling my sister she had it coming after she got shamed online for wearing white to her friend's wedding?","text":"my sister (zoe 28) attended her friend's wedding last week. she's friends with the groom. so last night I saw a tiktok post by the bride's sister (sandy 23) shaming zoe for wearing \"white\". I showed it to her and she freaked out. she called his friend (the groom) and told him to talk to his SIL to delete the post. I asked my sister why she thought that wearing white to a wedding was okay. I honestly can't blame sandy for shaming zoe as I would have done the same thing if someone wore white to my sister's wedding. I told zoe that she had it coming and she should apologize first before demanding to have the post deleted. my sister didn't like what I said, she's upset that I am not taking her side and called me an asshole. so am I an asshole?
