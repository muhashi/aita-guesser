I recently found out that the sorbet we make and offer to people who are vegan or dairy- or gluten-free isn&#39;t factually vegan; the stabilizer we add contains whey. So now I feel so horrible about having served so many people telling them that it&#39;s vegan when it isn&#39;t. But I feel like I&#39;m not in a position to tell our customers the truth, and now I don&#39;t know what to do. In addition, the sugar we use for all of the vegan things isn&#39;t vegan either, it&#39;s just the normal sugar we use for everything. I found out just yesterday about the stabilizer and I&#39;m honestly so upset with myself that I didn&#39;t know. Should I say something to my boss, because I don&#39;t feel comfortable lying to the customers, but I also would be really scared to go rogue and tell them the truth and potentially get in trouble with my boss?\nEDIT UPDATE: we are trying a different brand of stabilizer that is actually vegan and making sure that it freezes properly and doesnt separate (which happens to sorbet a lot). Hopefully all of the sorbets will be changed and fully vegan as soon as possible!!!</p>","verdict":"NTA"},{"id":"gx0ava","title":"WIBTA if I (33F) vaccinated my child against his anti vaxx fathers (36M) wishes.","text":"<p>Excuse my mistakes, english is not my first language.

FB used to make comments about me being a prostitute and other horrible names. Several years went by before FB got in touch asking for money to buy baby supplies. I have no relation to either FB or his child. \nFirst FB asked for £20 as his pay would not come through in time to be able to buy some food and nappies/diapers for the baby. I gave him some advice on where he could maybe get the money from. He said can you not just spare £20 and FB would pay me back. I don’t have a lot of money myself and often will try to help my friends out, which FB knows. He has since been calling non stop and messaging saying that I don’t care about him or his baby. \nAm I the asshole for not giving him £20\nEdit: I do have a learning disability just so you are aware in the comments.
