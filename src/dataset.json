I have been in a rocky relationship with their dad coming up 10 years. He has a majurana dependency which has caused a majority of issues in our relationship. As a non-smoker I'm not against him smoking. It's the financial burden (Spending up to $400 weekly) and time spent away from us (eg smoking with friends and family on a almost daily basis) that causes me to feel frustrated. When ever I bring up how I feel it causes major arguments and ends up in him telling me I'm controlling and he ends up taking off to his parents who tend to baby and enable him. He does help out with the kids after he has his \"Smoking time away\" i just wish we were higher on his priority list. Am I over reacting?",

The conclusion is that we should get 2x  six packs - In her words \"We'll split one, and save the other for tomorrow\" . I then bought them and when I got home put one in the fridge and one on the counter (I like them cold and she does not) and brought us over one beer each. Later she gets up to bring us another one each and is irritated that we are not indeed sharing a six pack. I explain that we can have 3 each out of the respective packs and have the same amount left over for tomorrow as per the plan. With the sole exception that I get cold ones, and she gets warm ones. Apparently I am wrong because somehow 2x(1\/2) a six pack Does not equal 1x six pack. Is this not equivalent? Is she justified for flying off the handle at this or am I the asshole?",

I told him on the call which he immediately refused. However, my friend Chad agreed. We went back and fourth with Red disagreeing and Chad and I laughing. Every word he said, sounded more similar to Dream. This went back and fourth for several minutes. I assumed it was all giggles. I couldn\u2019t stop laughing until tears started building up in my eyes. Eventually, the girlfriend left the call, saying she was uncomfortable. Now, I thought it was still jokes and Chad and I giggled on call for several minutes. However neither of them are responding. So AITA?",

I love them when I see them out and about or at a friends place, but I appreciate my space dog-free at home. For more context, my boyfriends dad is terminally ill, and doesn\u2019t have much time left. My boyfriend wants to get a dog that resembles his childhood dog once his dad passes away. Which, for the record, I\u2019d be willing to compromise on. However, he will not consider a different breed other than the huge dog-bear St. Bernard itself. I have already agreed to getting one once we move, (which is already a huge compromise because I never wanted a dog to begin with, especially one of that size. and the slobber\u2026.) but I will not agree to him to getting one while we live in a just-short-of 700 sq foot one bedroom apartment. He still insists on getting one, regardless of the lack of space and no consideration towards our 2 cats we already have in this tiny apartment. Am I in the wrong here?",

    "post_content":"My bestfriend has a brachial plexus injury  in her shoulder that affects her entire arm. She can\u2019t move it and it can\u2019t be pulled on. I want her to come with me to a festival this summer and she really wants to go, but is worried about her arm. I told her to wear a bright coloured cast or make a fake one that way everyone just thinks her arm is broken and tries to avoid it. Obviously it\u2019s still a bit riskier for her to be in a mosh pit, but I know that anyone who sees her with a cast will be just a bit more cautious around her. I know atleast I would be.<br/>She got mad at me and hasn\u2019t even explained why she is mad. I feel bad because I just wanna have fun together and I\u2019ve seen her disability hold her back from a lot of stuff and I know she does want to go. It\u2019s an annual festival and when I went this year she was so upset that she didn\u2019t, so I wanna make it so she can this year",

He said he planned to quit at the start of summer and then start making money from commissions on twitter. He told him that was a bad idea considering that AI has become such a big thing. He said it\u2019s fine and that he actually wanted to work with AI for inspiration. I argued that by saying that AI just does the whole job. He got mad telling me he\u2019d been working on improving in art for almost a year.<br/>I kept telling him to at least not quit his job but he was dead set on doing so. After that I blew up telling him that he probably won\u2019t even make any money considering that he\u2019s pretty much a amateur. I said \u201cWhy would anyone pay for your art when a AI could do it better than you!\u201d. He got quite then didn\u2019t say anything. After a few days he said he\u2019d given up on Art completely. Am I the asshole?",
