### Deployment

If you want to host this on your own domain, fork/clone the repo and run `npm install` at the root. In `vite.config.json` change the `base` attribute to whatever directory you will be hosting on. Run `npm run dev` to make sure it compiles correctly, and then commit to your repo. If deploying with GH Pages, you will need to set GH Pages to deploy via Actions, and allow Actions permissions to read and write.
